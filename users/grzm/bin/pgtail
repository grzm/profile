## http://superuser.com/questions/117596/how-to-tail-the-latest-file-in-a-directory
## Removed timestamp printing because isn't supported on Mac OS X
## Assumes filenames are sortable by timestamp

## assumes log dir is $PGDATA/pg_log

LOG_EXT=${1:-log}

## should confirm ext is log or csv

LOGDIR="$PGDATA/pg_log"
FILEPATTERN="*.${LOG_EXT}"
LOGFILE="$(find "${LOGDIR}" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "${FILEPATTERN}" | sort | tail -n 1)"
echo "tailing ${LOGFILE}"

tail -f "${LOGFILE}"
